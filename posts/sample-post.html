<h1>My First Steps Into Machine Learning</h1>

<p>
Two weeks ago, my Algorithms professor suggested that I take a look into Machine Learning and AI. 
Before that moment, my knowledge of the field was basically zero — I just knew it was a rapidly growing 
area of computer science. I figured it couldn’t hurt to try it out, and I had always been curious how 
applications like ChatGPT could behave so intelligently. That curiosity ended up pulling me in far deeper 
than I expected.
</p>

<h2>Building Fundamental Knowledge</h2>

<p>
I started with Andrew Ng’s “Machine Learning Specialization,” which helped me understand the building blocks 
of the entire field — things like regression, gradient descent, and the foundations of classification. 
The way he teaches makes the ideas feel approachable, even if they're brand new.
</p>

<p>
I also watched Coding Train’s perceptron series and 3Blue1Brown’s neural network explanation. 
Both focused more on intuition and theory, and that combination of visuals and math helped everything 
start to “click.”
</p>

</div>

<p>
The moment that hooked me was recreating the simple neural network from Coding Train’s video and watching it 
actually learn. Seeing a model improve without being explicitly programmed to do so felt almost surreal — 
like watching a simple idea suddenly come alive.

<h2>Using PyTorch and Building My First Projects</h2>

<p>
After getting comfortable with the fundamentals, I wanted to build something real — which meant learning PyTorch.
At first, PyTorch felt overwhelming. It’s powerful, but that also means you run into situations where the code 
doesn’t work unless you understand what’s happening underneath: tensor shapes, autograd, loss functions, model 
architectures, optimizers, all of it.
</p>

<p>
I started with freeCodeCamp’s PyTorch course, which gave me a structured foundation. Once I moved to Google Colab 
and began writing my own models, things got much more challenging — and way more interesting. I had to constantly 
read documentation, search through GitHub issues, look up unfamiliar functions, and debug errors that made no sense 
at first glance.
</p>

<p>
AI assistants helped a lot too, especially when I didn’t understand why a certain operation behaved the way it did. 
But even with help, the learning came from struggling with the code, breaking it, fixing it, and slowly building an 
intuition for how PyTorch actually works.
</p>

<p>
By the time I finished my first two ML projects, I realized something: you never “memorize” PyTorch. You learn how 
to navigate it. You learn how to look up the right things, how to reason about your model, and how to interpret 
errors instead of being intimidated by them. That skill — the ability to explore and experiment — is what made the 
whole experience so rewarding.
</p>

<p>
This is just the beginning, but it’s already made me excited to keep going deeper into machine learning, both 
the theory and the engineering side of it.
