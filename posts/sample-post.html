<h1>My First Steps Into Machine Learning</h1>

<p>
Two weeks ago, my Algorithms professor recommended that I explore machine learning and AI.
Before that moment I had almost no experience — I just knew it was important and rapidly
growing. That initial curiosity quickly turned into genuine interest as I began to understand
how these models actually learn.

<h2>Building Foundational Knowledge</h2>

<div class="media-block reverse">
    <p>
    I started with Andrew Ng’s "Machine Learning Specialization," where I learned the basics:
    regression, gradient descent, classification, and the foundations behind training a model.
    His explanations made difficult concepts surprisingly intuitive.
    </p>

<!-- ========================= -->
<h2>Visual Intuition & Neural Networks</h2>

<div class="media-block">
    <p>
    The visual explanations from Coding Train and 3Blue1Brown helped me understand neural networks
    on an intuitive level. Seeing activations, weights, and decision boundaries change during
    training made everything feel *alive*. This was the point where machine learning stopped being
    abstract and started becoming something I genuinely enjoyed exploring.
    </p>

<!-- CONCLUSION GOES HERE (as requested) -->

<div class="conclusion">
    <p>
    I have detailed reports of the projects on my GitHub page for both my 
    <a href="#" target="_blank">Housing Prices Predictor</a> 
    and my 
    <a href="#" target="_blank">Diabetes Classification Model</a>.
    The key take-away is this: by starting with small, focused projects you can set building blocks for larger, cooler ones.

    As I progressed further, I began exploring PyTorch seriously — learning tensors, shaping data,
    debugging layers, testing optimizers, and designing my own models from scratch. This was where
    machine learning stopped being "learning" and started becoming "building."

Every mistake taught me something. Every small success — even a tiny bump in accuracy — kept me going.
Machine learning is a field where curiosity compounds… and it becomes very addictive.
