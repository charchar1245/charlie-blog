<h1>How I Went From 0 ML Knowledge to Building My First Two Projects</h1>

<p>
Two weeks ago, my Algorithms professor recommended that I explore the subject of Machine Learning and AI. 
I had no prior knowledge of the subject, other than knowing it was an emerging field in Computer Science, 
my field of study in college. I decided I would give it a try. After all, I had always wondered how applications 
like ChatGPT could so effortlessly mimic humans when it came to doing just about anything.
</p>

<h2>Building Fundamental Knowledge</h2>

<p>
I started by watching Andrew Ng’s “Machine Learning Specialization,” which walks through topics like 
multiple linear regression, logistic regression for classification, gradient descent, and many of the 
core ideas that modern ML is built on. I would highly recommend it.
</p>

<p>
I also found Coding Train’s perceptron series and 3Blue1Brown’s legendary neural network video extremely 
helpful. Both are theory-focused and do an incredible job of making complex topics feel intuitive.

<p>
The moment I knew I wanted to pursue this field was when I built the simple neural network from the Coding Train’s 
video and watched it train with my own eyes. It’s one thing to understand the math, but it’s completely different 
when you actually see a model improve on its own. Watching such a simple system behave intelligently was surreal.
</p>

<h2>Using PyTorch and Building My First Projects</h2>

<p>
Once I felt grounded in the fundamentals, it was time to move from theory to actually building something. 
That meant learning PyTorch — something that, at first, felt like a completely different world. 
Unlike the neatly packaged examples in videos, real ML code requires understanding layers, tensors, 
optimizers, shapes, losses, and dozens of small details that aren’t always intuitive.
</p>

<p>
I started with the “Machine Learning with Python – PyTorch” tutorial from freeCodeCamp, which gave me just 
enough structure to begin experimenting. But the real learning happened once I moved to Google Colab and 
started working on my own projects. Suddenly, I had to read documentation for every layer I used, look up 
what different loss functions meant, and understand why certain operations failed because tensors weren’t 
the right shape.
</p>

</a>

<p>
I leaned heavily on library documentation, GitHub issues, StackOverflow discussions, and honestly, a lot of 
AI assistance. Whenever I didn’t understand what a PyTorch function was doing under the hood, I had to pause, 
look it up, and really dig into how the model architecture worked. I wasn’t just copying code — I was trying 
to understand why each line existed, and what would break if I removed it.
</p>

<p>
By the time I finished my two projects, I realized that PyTorch isn’t something you “memorize.” It’s a huge 
toolbox that you learn to navigate. The real skill is knowing what to look up, how to troubleshoot your own 
mistakes, and how to read documentation without getting overwhelmed. And honestly, that’s what made this stage 
the most rewarding — I could feel myself learning how to think like a machine learning engineer.
</p>

<p>
This is only the beginning, but it’s been an exciting first step into a field that I never expected to enjoy 
this much. The more I build, the more I realize how much there is to explore.
