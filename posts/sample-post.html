<h1>My First Steps Into Machine Learning</h1>

<p>
Two weeks ago, my Algorithms professor recommended that I explore Machine Learning and AI. 
Before that moment, I had almost no experience with the field — I just knew it was important 
and rapidly growing. I decided to give it a try, mostly out of curiosity about how tools like 
ChatGPT perform so intelligently. That curiosity quickly turned into genuine interest.
</p>


<h2>Building Fundamental Knowledge</h2>

<div class="media-block">
    <p>
    I started with Andrew Ng’s “Machine Learning Specialization,” which introduced the core 
    ideas of the field — linear and logistic regression, gradient descent, and the foundations 
    of classification. His teaching style makes the concepts feel intuitive, even if you're new.
    </p>

    I also watched Coding Train’s perceptron series and 3Blue1Brown’s neural network explanation. 
    These videos emphasize intuition and visuals, and they helped connect the theoretical pieces 
    together in a way that made everything finally “click.”

    The moment I became truly invested was when I followed the Coding Train tutorial and built a 
    simple neural network myself. Watching it actually learn — not just seeing the math on paper — 
    made the subject feel alive and incredibly compelling.

<h2>Using PyTorch and Building My First Projects</h2>

<div class="media-block">
    <p>
    After learning the fundamentals, I wanted to build real projects. That meant learning PyTorch, 
    which was challenging at first. Unlike simple tutorial examples, real ML coding requires 
    understanding tensor shapes, losses, optimizers, model architectures, and how everything 
    interacts during training.
    </p>

<p>
I began with freeCodeCamp’s PyTorch course, which gave me enough structure to get started. Once I moved into 
Google Colab and began making my own models, things became more demanding — in a good way. I had to constantly 
look up documentation, read about different layers, debug shape mismatches, and use AI tools to understand exactly 
what each operation was doing under the hood.
</p>

<p>
I wasn’t just trying to write code that “worked” — I wanted to understand every line. Why does this reshape matter? 
What exactly is this loss function measuring? Why does training collapse if you choose the wrong learning rate? 
Those questions forced me to explore much deeper than the surface level.
</p>

<p>
By the time I finished my two projects, I realized something important: you don’t memorize PyTorch — you learn 
how to navigate it. You learn how to explore, experiment, and troubleshoot in a way that makes you a better 
machine learning developer overall.
