<h1>My First Steps Into Machine Learning</h1>

<p>
Two weeks ago, my Algorithms professor suggested that I take a look into Machine Learning and AI. 
Before that moment, my experience with the field was basically nonexistent — I only knew it was an 
exciting and fast-growing area of computer science. I decided to try it out, mostly out of curiosity 
about how tools like ChatGPT could behave so intelligently. That curiosity quickly pulled me in.
</p>


<h2>Building Fundamental Knowledge</h2>

<p>
I started with Andrew Ng’s “Machine Learning Specialization,” which helped me understand the building 
blocks of the field — linear regression, logistic regression, gradient descent, and the foundations of 
classification. The way he teaches makes the ideas feel approachable, even if they're brand new.
</p>

<p>
I also watched Coding Train’s perceptron series and 3Blue1Brown’s neural network explanation. Both videos 
focus heavily on intuition and theory, and the combination of visuals and math made everything start to “click.”

<p>
The moment I truly became interested was when I built the simple neural network from Coding Train’s video 
and watched it improve on its own. Seeing a model learn firsthand — not just in theory — made the subject feel alive.

<h2>Using PyTorch and Building My First Projects</h2>

<p>
After the fundamentals, I wanted to start building real projects. That meant learning PyTorch — a powerful 
but initially overwhelming library. Unlike the neatly packaged examples in videos, real ML development requires 
understanding tensor shapes, layers, optimizers, loss functions, and how all the pieces fit together.
</p>

<p>
I began with freeCodeCamp’s PyTorch course, which gave me the structure I needed to start experimenting. 
Once I moved to Google Colab and began writing my own models, I had to dig much deeper. I was constantly 
reading documentation, searching GitHub issues, and asking AI tools to explain why certain operations behaved 
the way they did.
</p>

<p>
I wasn’t just copying code — I was trying to understand every line. Why does this dimension need to match that one? 
What does this loss function actually measure? Why does everything break when you reshape a tensor incorrectly? 
That process of breaking things, fixing them, and experimenting is what taught me the most.
</p>

<p>
By the time I completed my first two projects, I realized something important: you don’t “memorize” PyTorch — 
you learn how to navigate it. You learn how to look up the right things, reason about your model’s behavior, 
and interpret errors without getting discouraged. That skill alone made the entire experience incredibly rewarding.
</p>

<p>
These first steps were challenging, but they made me genuinely excited to go deeper into both the theoretical 
and practical sides of machine learning.
