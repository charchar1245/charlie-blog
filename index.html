<p>
    Two weeks ago, my Algorithms professor recommended that I explore the subject of Machine Learning and AI. 
    I had no prior knowledge of the subject, other than knowing it was an emerging field in Computer Science. 
    I decided I would give it a try, and I started with the basics: learning what a model really is, how data flows 
    through a network, and how training actually works.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of this first section, I want to highlight what really inspired me. It wasn’t just a concept or a 
    definition—it was seeing an actual neural network train, in real time, using only PyTorch code. Watching it learn 
    how to recognize images from scratch made something click for me. That was the moment I realized how powerful and 
    intuitive machine learning could actually be.

<p>
    After getting comfortable with the fundamentals, I wanted to build something. My first project was a Housing Price 
    Predictor. I wanted to understand regression, feature weights, normalization, and the entire cycle of training, testing, 
    and evaluating performance. This project gave me hands-on experience with real numerical data.

<h2>Understanding Neural Networks</h2>

<p>
    For my second project, I wanted to push myself further and explore classification. This led me to create a neural 
    network that determines whether a patient has diabetes. It was fascinating to see the model learn patterns that 
    humans could not easily see. 
</p>

<p>
    The video that sparked this step in my journey was this one:  
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BYECoI-v2c" target="_blank">Watch the PyTorch Training Video</a>.  
    Seeing the network update its weights and gradually improve its predictions was what inspired me to keep going. 
    It made neural networks feel alive.

<p>
    To build an even stronger foundation, I began studying from freeCodeCamp’s machine learning resources. They broke down 
    complex topics like backpropagation, gradient descent, and vectorized operations in a way that made everything click.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    If you'd like to see my reports on these project in more detail, you can view my 
    <a href="#">Housing Price Predictor</a> or my 
    <a href="#">Diabetes Classifier</a>. 
    The key take-away is this, by starting with small, focused projects you can have the building blocks of knowledge needed for larger, much cooler projects.
